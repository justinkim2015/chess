This is the final project for the ruby portion of TOP.  I'm really excited to get working on this because after I finish I can move into learning some frameworks and other things that are used daily at companies.  I really want to start making personal projects that I can deploy to the internet and hopefully some of these things will actually be useful to myself and others.  

This project seems like a really big step-up in scale over the rest of the projects I've done until now and I think before I start I should really sit down and figure out what my plan is for this.
